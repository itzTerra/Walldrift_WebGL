## Walldrift (WebGL)  
WebGL export of an Android game made with Unity.  
*(Slightly older version)*  

### Possible improvements
- Fair slider obstacles (based on player distance - always dodgable)
- Biomes (different visuals, obstacles, backgrounds...)
- Player customization, skins
- Some slowdown mechanic that can be used by the player
- Choosable perks maybe at the start and every x distance travelled

***This project is currently abandoned***
